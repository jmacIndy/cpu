# README file for *CPU* project

This is sample readme file for the *CPU* project.

This is a virtual CPU. It "builds" a CPU in an object, including the
registers, flags, memory, stack, and heap.

It loads, reads, and executes an assembly language that I created just
for this CPU.

## Plans:
* Add an assembler.
* Finish code for remaining assembly instructions.
* Create unit tests.
* Create main program to drive execution of CPU.
* Change from current 8-bit machine to 16-bit.
* Begin building operating system to run in CPU.
